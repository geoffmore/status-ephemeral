For each Service, there will be one or more Components. The Service itself is a
Component.

Each Component will have 24 1-hour Statuses sorted by recent. The time frame
used by all Components will be the same. valid Statuses are "red", "yellow", and
"green".

The status of each Component will be stored in a common database. To retrieve
these statuses, a query will be made


Each day will be subdivided into 24 sections. 7 days worth of data will be
displayed

Maybe there can be an array of timestamps? This would guide the new queries,
rather than letting each Component dictacte its own time
